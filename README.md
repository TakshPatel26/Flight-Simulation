📖 About
This is a 3D flight simulation game made for web browsers. You can control a plane, fly in a virtual world, and experience simple flight mechanics.

- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- A-Frame (3D Web Framework)

🚀 Features
- Fly a plane in real-time  
- 3D environment with simple controls

🧩 How It Works
1. Open the link in a browser  
2. Use WASD keys or arrow keys to control the plane  
3. Explore the environment and enjoy flying
